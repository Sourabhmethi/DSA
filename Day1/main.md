# What is Data Structure and Algorithm

Ans: Lets take an example of libraray where we see how books are stored in library --- this is Data structure
and how to use that book by name,genre -- this is Algorithms

Types of Data Structure:
Their are two types of Data Structure
1.Linear Data Structure:
Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue

2.Non Linear Data Structure:
Tree
Graph
Hash Table

Types of Algorithm:
Sorting Algorithms
Searching Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms
Divide & Conquer Algorithms
Dynamic Programming

# What is Linked List:

Linked List is a linear data structure it consist node where each node contains data and each node point to the next node in the sequence.

Types of Linked List:

1. Single linked list
2. Doubly Linked list
3. Circular Linked List

# what is Stack

Ans. A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last in first out principle.

For example: It just like a Plate system the Last Plate comes it removes first

Core Operations of a Stack:

1. Push
2. Pop
3. Peek
4. isEmpty

# What is Queue

Ans: A queue is data Structure that follows the First in First out Principle.It means the element insert first it remove first

For Example: Waiting Lines for buyi

Core Operations of a Queue:

1.Enqueue
2.Dequeue
3.Front
4.ISEmpty
